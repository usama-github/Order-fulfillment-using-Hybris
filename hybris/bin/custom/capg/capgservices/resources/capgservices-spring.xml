	<!-- The hybris platform provides one single Spring application context 
		for beans located at the jalo layer. Each extension can add beans to this 
		context by specifying them at this configuration file. You can use and/or 
		redefine beans defined at configuration files of other extensions as well 
		as adding new one. If you want to locate this file at a different location 
		or want to use several files for better, structuring, please use the '<yourextension>.application-context' 
		property at your project.properties file. There you can specify a comma separated 
		list of files where first is tried to find a file per classpath and then 
		per file system. If you want to configure beans for your web module please 
		have a look at your web/webroot/WEB-INF/<extname>-web-spring.xml. -->
